### EDUCATION 

You will always win the arguments you have with others insie your head. You will always understand the points you make to others inside your head. 

To that end, I am currently in the middle of a Masters of Philosophy, Art and Critical Thought at the European Graduate School to get outside my head.

I have an MLIS from Drexel University that allowed me to work at:

## WORK EXPERIENCE

Swarthmore College, Libraires currently as the Head of Research and Instruction and Humanities Librarian. I was the Humanities Librarian before but my supervisor, who was very thoughtful, spoke on my behalf. I startered working at Swarthmore Libraries in 2013 in a 9 month position and with a combination of a lot of luck and work, I became the Library Resident. 

I have had other jobs before, both as a failed community organizer and in a health center. For me, there was no sign I would become a librarian so I am hesitant to romantize my path to where I work now. That said, these previous positions greatly affected how I think about work in general.

I now do a combination of digital and liaison work. When I started my work, specially in Digital Scholarship, I knew very little coding but Nabil Kashyap was super helpful and gracious as he taught along. Some of what I know is:

# Digital knowledge 

	Web & Frameworks: HTML, CSS, Jekyll, Django, Omeka CMS, Wordpress CMS
	Computer Languages: Python, PHP, R, JavaScript

Since tools come and go please don't look too closely into the list above but hopefully what you see is a desire to learn something new and an ability to learn something new

In trying to make sense of what I've done during my time at Swarthmore, I have worked with my colleagues in writting the following:

I have also presented at conferences and taught at [DREAM](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dream-lab/) since 2019. The two most recent presentations I did were

# Two recent presentations

// “Collaborating on nothing: spaces for learning and reflecting on Digital Scholarship. DLF 2022. October, 2022

I include these presentations because they were about two topics I have been recenlty tihnking about: 

1. Analogue vs Digital 
2. Unproductive spaces

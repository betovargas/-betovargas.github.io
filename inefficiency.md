        “Technique is the totality of methods, rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity.” Jacques Ellul, **The Technological Society**

This urge to find the most **efficient** methodological techniques in whatever we do needs to be gone. As Jacques Ellul would later expand, technique is not the issue but its revelation in efficiency. 

The statement **I agree with you, but we can't do anything** has this urge for efficiency in mind. When I disagree with a method, approach, topic, and action I will react leaving efficiency behind. We need slowness not for own individual benefit (like for example, for the consumeristic understanding of "self car") but as a way to get rid of productivity and efficiency as the main drivers in our lives.

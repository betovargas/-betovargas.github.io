# A reaction

- The **"anti"** prefix implicit in words like obfuscation, inefficiency, non-future oriented, skill-less is ultimately a reaction to current modes of approaching work, views on technology and ways of thinking in the libraries. To be reactionary can exclude proactiveness. I disagree. I agree that these words are reactive but my impulse in using these words is different than how **reactionary** is used in our current poliltical environment. These reactive words come from an acceptance (but not resignation) that we are in a kind of realism. Mark Fisher wrote about a "Capitalist Reaslim" which holds us captive to our present without the ability to imagine an alternative. Taking this reactive approach is an acknolewgement that we start from an unimaginative place and that our only alternative is to react.

# Origin

- In attending talks, conferences, meetings, getherings, etc... the mode of thinking (the status quo) is always a *yes* and *no* to questionable technology and its uses. The *no* comes from a moral imperative and thoughtfuless that certain technological tools and methods are anithetical to what we claim in libraires. The *yes* comes from a resignation that we can't do anything in affecting the structure of our organizations and we must say *yes* to these technologies while keeping a critial stance (a *no* hidden in a *yes*). I would like to move away from this *yes* and *no* tug. This *yes* and *no* approach both acknolewledges a type of realism and at the same time says "your are stuck here and also you can't react nor deconstruct." This is reflected in the often asked question, usually after a talk critial of technologies used in libraries, that goes something like this: "I agree with you but we can't do anything to change" either because of our current job posiiton or organizational strucutre. If we do live in a limited space, the only thing we can do is react without producing a change. To expect to produce is to give into the strucure's assumption. In other words, if our ourganizations' imperative on us is to produce / be proactive then to say we can't react because it is not producing is to limit ourselves to the imperative of what we are trying to change. Surely, we don't have taker the assumption that the only possible way to react is when it produces something. We are free to react without producing

## in progress

A mistake, as a category, can be broken apart. A mistake is a consequence of an action and I believe, within the context of libraries, what this action is matters more than the fact a mistake was done. Putting aside intentional mistakes that hurt people or organizations, mistake-prone is an approach that welcomes mistakes as a result of a desire to do good. Not to be confused with the "move fast and break things" ethos of software development, mistake-prone has no need for speed nor production

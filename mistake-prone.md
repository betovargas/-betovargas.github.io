## in progress

A mistake is a general category that needs to be broken apart. A mistake is a consequence of an action and I believe, within the context of libraries, what these action are matter more than if a mistake was done. Putting aside intentional mistakes that hurt people or organizations, mistake-prone is an approach that welcomes mistakes as a result of a desire to do good.
